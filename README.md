## Cool Features :
### Auto Find Cube
Uses A Pixy Camera to find the closest block and drive to it.
### PID Loops for Main elevator and picker elevator
Custom Loops to keep the Picker and Main Elevator in the desired position. This helps battle gravity. It is very helpful for auto too. All we have to do is set the target and the elevator goes there as quickly and efficiently as possible.
### Motion Paths for auto
These are paths that we generated to move our robot during auto. They use the gyro and encoders on drive left and drive right to get the robot where it needs to go.
### Complete Logging System
We log everything! This is helpful because we know exactly what is going on with the robot. It can also be used to make sure everything is accurate.
